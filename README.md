# GTPS3 Source by SrMotion (Discord: sundei#1337)
Growtopia Private Server GTPS3 (Source from 2022, leaked by SrMotion, because Vyte scammed his 750$)

# The story, why SrMotion leaked the source.
Vyte, the original owner of GTPS3, offered SrMotion a lucrative deal of $2000 to develop the server. After evaluating the offer, SrMotion decided to take on the task of developing it. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until SrMotion completed a significant portion of the work and requested a payment of $750.

To his surprise, Vyte blocked him for a week and refused to make the payment. This caused SrMotion to become suspicious of Vyte's intentions and behavior. Upon further investigation, he discovered that Vyte had a notorious reputation for scamming in the GTPS community. SrMotion quickly realized that he had been lured into a trap by Vyte's enticing offer.

As it turns out, Vyte had a history of scamming server developers and was known for blocking them after they had completed a significant amount of work. He would then take credit for their work and steal their ideas to make a quick profit.

SrMotion and I decided to take action against Vyte's unethical practices. We gathered evidence of his past scams and compiled them into a comprehensive report. We also leaked information about Vyte's hard work and exposed the truth behind his deceptive practices.

We strongly advise others to be cautious when dealing with Vyte or anyone with a similar reputation in the GTPS community. It is important to thoroughly research and vet potential business partners to avoid falling victim to scams and frauds.

In conclusion, SrMotion and I were able to uncover the truth about Vyte's fraudulent practices and warn others about the dangers of doing business with him. By exposing his unethical behavior, we hope to prevent others from falling prey to similar scams in the future.

# Attention! Before joining any GTPS 3 based servers, please read this important notice.

I would like to bring to your attention that there is a serious security concern associated with GTPS3 and GTPS3 based servers, including Royal GTPS, Gold PS, and GTPS ID, which are owned by Vyte. Upon connecting to these servers, Vyte has the ability to download a RAT (Remote Administration Tool) onto your PC without your knowledge or consent. This is a major red flag and poses a significant risk to your privacy and security.

The RAT is downloaded from the "items.dat" file and is placed in the autostart location of your system. The problem is that "rttex" can be downloaded to any directory, including executable files such as .com and .exe. This makes it easy for Vyte to gain unauthorized access to your personal information and files, including sensitive data such as login credentials, financial information, and private documents.

I strongly advise against playing on these servers and recommend that you take all necessary precautions to protect yourself from potential harm. If you have already connected to any of these servers, I recommend that you scan your system for any signs of malware or suspicious activity. It is also important to keep your operating system and antivirus software up to date to minimize the risk of a security breach.

In conclusion, it is crucial to be vigilant and cautious when playing on GTPS3 and GTPS3 based servers owned by Vyte. The potential risks associated with these servers are significant and should not be taken lightly. Please take the necessary steps to protect yourself and your personal information from unauthorized access and malicious activity.

Behold, the irrefutable evidence that Vyte is nothing more than a dishonest and deceitful scammer.
